CGA-SLAC

A roguelike in CGA (more specifically the 160x100 16-color 'graphics' mode).
Why is it called SLAC?  There's no secret, no legacy and there's only one
ancient cave.  To that I say 'Why not?'

The story:

There is no story.  Your goal is to enter the dungeon, descend to the 30th floor,
kill Megalith, retreive the Orb of Power and return it to the surface, all without
dying.  Like most traditional roguelikes, death is permanent.

While in the dungeon, you will find equipment, potions, scrolls, money and lots of
monsters.  The equipment will (hopefully) make you stronger, making it easier to
kill monsters.  Money is used to add to your final score, assuming you actually
manage to complete the task.

Combat:

Combat is just like any other roguelike - bump into an enemy to do damage.  Melee
combat is the only form available.  

Stats:

Level:    The player's level.  Caps at 50.
HP:       The player's current HP.  A combination of level-attained HP value and 
		  modifiers based on strength and defense values
XP:       The amount of experience obtained toward the next level
Gold:     Collected currency.  Used to calculate final score when the game is finished
          (for leaderboard placement)
Attack:   Increases the amount of damage you do, and contributes (somewhat) to 
          total HP
Defense:  Reduces the amount of damage you take, and contributes (somewhat) to
          total HP
Speed:    Determines whether you or enemies get to go first.  For every enemy
          in line of sight, their speeds and your speed are used to determine
		  turn order.  In some cases, an enemy or the player may get to take
		  two (or more) turns ahead of anyone else if fast enough.
		  
Luck:     Increases the chance of critically hitting an enemy
	
Formulas:

Damage = Attack - Defense (-50% - +25%) ((damage >> 2) to (damage + damage >> 4))
Min damage = 1
Critical hit = damage * 2

HP = Base HP + (attack / 8) + (defense / 4)

Ex: Lv 48, HP = 255 + 6 + 12 = 273

Weapons:
 - wooden dagger
 - steel dagger
 - mythril dagger
 - wooden sword
 - steel sword
 - mythril sword 
 - wooden longsword
 - steel longsword
 - mythril longsword
 - wooden axe
 - steel axe
 - mythril axe
 
Any weapon can have a +X modifier, from +0 (standard) to +5
For each +1 on a weapon, the attack value increases by (base weapon attack / 4)
(So a weapon +5 will have 2.25x the base damage of the weapon)
All weapons have a different base value and different speed
  - daggers have a net increase to speed (better daggers offer more speed)
  - swords have no speed penalty
  - axes have a small speed penalty (fixed for all axe types)
  - longswords have a larger speed penalty (better longswords give a larger speed penalty)

each +1 has a 25% chance of occurring:
  - +1 - ~25%   (chance < 25) 1x in a row
  - +2 - ~6%    (chance < 25) 2x in a row
  - +3 - ~1%    (chance < 25) 3x in a row
  - +4 - ~0.25% (chance < 25) 4x in a row
  - +5 - ~0.06% (chance < 25) 5x in a row
  
All weapons have a relative rarity and minimum dungeon level
  - If an item would roll out of depth, a second check is done to see if the item
    should drop:
	  - 1 floors above - 50% chance      (chance < 50)
	  - 2 floors above - 25% chance      (chance < 25)
	  - 3 floors above - 12% chance      (chance < 12)
	  - 4 floors above - 6% chance       (chance < 6)
	  - 5 floors above - 3% chance       (chance < 3)
	  - >5 floors above - 0.5% chance    2 rolls - (chance == 0) and (chance < 50)
