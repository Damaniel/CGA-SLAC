# CGA-SLAC
A CGA-based roguelike targeting any DOS PC.

## About
This game is being created as part of the 2025 DOSember Game Jam.  It's 
a roguelike written in Turbo Pascal that takes advantage of the CGA's 
semi-documented 160x100, 16 color text 'graphics' mode.  

Descend 30 floors into the dungeon, defeat Megalith, take the orb and
return it to the surface.  Pretty straightforward, but the graphics
mode is novel...

## Planned system requirements

The goal is to run on just about anything PC related.  Specifically, the targeted
specs are:

- IBM PC/XT class or better
- 640KB RAM (though if possible, I'd like to keep it under 512KB)
- CGA adapter.  
- PC speaker
